    q: "What is MunchQuest?",
    a: "MunchQuest is a restaurant discovery site with reviews where users can browse restaurants, review restaurants, and administer restaurant listings. Restaurant owners can personalize their menus and administer their presence on the site."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need an account to use MunchQuest?",
    a: "You can browse restaurants anonymously. But to review or administer restaurants, you will have to sign up or sign in with Firebase authentication."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I add a new restaurant?",
    a: "When you are logged in, go to the 'Add Restaurant' page. Complete the form with the information of the restaurant and submit it. If you are a verified owner, the restaurant will be included in the listing."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I edit or delete a restaurant?",
    a: "Yes â€” if you are the owner of the restaurant, you can delete or edit it from the restaurant's detail page. Unauthorised users won't be able to see the edit/delete links."
  },
  {
    q: "Who can edit menus for restaurants?",
    a: "Restaurant owners can edit menus. This gives you a completely customisable and dynamic experience for every restaurant listing."
  },
  {
    q: 'Why am i stuck on "Loading..."?',
    a: "Sometimes backend hosting services might have cold starts that result in minor delays. It usually resolves within 1-2 minutes"
  },
  {
    q: "How does reviewing work?",
    a: "Users can post a star rating and a brief review for any restaurant. Reviews are seen by every user and affect the restaurant's average rating."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I add images with a restaurant?",
    a: "No, not as of now. When adding a restaurant, a picture is assigned automatically from a curated collection, and owners can replace it through Cloudinary integration (coming soon)."
  },
  {
    q: "Is MunchQuest mobile-friendly?",
    a: "Definitely. The whole interface is responsive and mobile/desktop device-optimized using TailwindCSS."
  },
  {
    q: "How is my data secured?",
    a: "Authentication is managed through Firebase for safe login and session handling. Protected routes are accessible only to logged-in users, and sensitive operations such as edits or deletions can be performed."
